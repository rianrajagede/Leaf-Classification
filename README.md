# Leaf Classification using Scikit-Image

Simple example of leaf image classification using Python (using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)) and [Scikit-Image](scikit-image.org). Feature extraction method using [Hu's Moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_moment) and classified using Simple Neural Network.

## Prerequisites
This program needs some requirements written in requirements.txt. Install it using the command below (after you install pip on your system):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

Data that used in this program modified from leaves dataset taken by Markus Weber (1999): [data source](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/leaves/leaves.tar). I only use two classes that has been splitted in `train_1/` and `train_2/`. Data test in `test/` is images of mixed from the two classes
